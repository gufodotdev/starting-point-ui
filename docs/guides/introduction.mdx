Starting Point UI is an open-source component library built for Tailwind CSS.

## What is Starting Point UI?

Tailwind CSS doesn't include pre-built components or JavaScript for interactive elements. Starting Point UI fills this gap by providing class names for common components like buttons, cards, form elements, dialogs, and more. It also includes optional JavaScript for interactive components like dialogs and dropdowns.

Starting Point UI is designed to work in any Tailwind CSS project regardless of setup. Whether you're using a JavaScript framework, a templating engine, or plain HTML, you can use the same library across all your projects. The JavaScript uses event delegation to ensure interactions work automatically, whether elements were rendered on page load or added dynamically later, making it compatible with most frameworks and rendering models.

## Inspiration

The styling is inspired by [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com) and uses the same CSS variables, making it easy to adopt for those already familiar with Shadcn.

The JavaScript takes inspiration from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com).
