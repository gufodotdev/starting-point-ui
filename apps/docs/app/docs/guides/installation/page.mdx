# Installation

Starting Point UI is a component library built on Tailwind CSS that provides useful class names for common patterns while staying framework agnostic. Learn more in the [Introduction](/docs/guides/introduction).

---

## Prerequisites

- A project using Tailwind CSS v4+

---

## Install the package

```bash
npm install starting-point-ui
```

The examples on this site use the [tw-animate-css](https://github.com/Wombosvideo/tw-animate-css) package for animations. This is completely optional. You can use other animation libraries or write your own:

```bash
npm install tw-animate-css
```

---

## Import the styles

Add the import to your main CSS file:

```css label="app/globals.css"
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "starting-point-ui";
@import "tw-animate-css"; /* optional */
```

---

## Add the JavaScript (optional)

For interactive components like dialogs and dropdowns, you can include the JavaScript. This is completely optional. You can use just the styles and pair them with your own JavaScript or a headless UI library like [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com) or [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com).

### Using a CDN

```html label="index.html"
<script
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/starting-point-ui"
  type="module"
></script>
```

### Using a bundler

For client-side bundlers like Vite, you can import directly in your entry file:

```ts label="main.ts"
import "starting-point-ui";
```

### SSR frameworks

If you're using a framework with server-side rendering, you may need to ensure the script only runs on the client after the DOM is ready. This is how it's loaded on this site, which is a Next.js App Router project:

```tsx label="components/StartingPointUI.tsx"
"use client";

import { useEffect } from "react";

export function StartingPointUI() {
  useEffect(() => {
    import("starting-point-ui");
  }, []);

  return null;
}
```

Then include it in your root layout:

```tsx label="app/layout.tsx"
import { StartingPointUI } from "@/components/StartingPointUI";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        {children}
        <StartingPointUI />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

---

## Font (optional)

The examples on this site use [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) as the font. If you want the same look and feel, you can add it to your project. Here's an example using a CDN:

```html
<head>
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.bunny.net" />
  <link href="https://fonts.bunny.net/css?family=inter:400,500,600,700" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>
```

Or load it directly in your CSS:

```css
@import url("https://fonts.bunny.net/css?family=inter:400,500,600,700");
```

Then set it as the default font:

```css
@theme inline {
  --font-sans: "Inter", sans-serif;
}
```

---
