# Introduction

Starting Point UI is an open-source component library built on top of Tailwind CSS.

---

## What is Starting Point UI?

Starting Point UI provides useful class names for common patterns like buttons, cards, and dialogs while allowing you to completely customize everything using Tailwind CSS utilities. It also includes an optional JavaScript library for interactive components like dialogs and dropdowns that works in any setup.

Starting Point UI aims to be framework agnostic, meaning you can use it in any project as long as you have Tailwind CSS installed. Whether you're using Vue, React, Angular, or no JavaScript framework at all, Starting Point UI lets you create consistent designs across every project without learning a new library for each framework.

## Philosophy

One challenge with Tailwind CSS is that it doesn't include pre-built components or JavaScript for interactive elements. The goal with Starting Point UI is to fill this gap by providing a starting point for your UIs. It handles base styles and functionality for common components like buttons, cards, dialogs, and dropdowns while still allowing you to easily customize every aspect using CSS variables and Tailwind utility classes. It aims to work in any setup, so you can use the same library across all your projects regardless of framework.

## Inspiration

The styling is inspired by [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com) and uses the same CSS variables, making it easy to adopt for those already familiar with Shadcn.

The JavaScript takes inspiration from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com). It uses event delegation to stay framework agnostic and suspends unmounts while animations play out, making animations a breeze.
