---

Starting Point UI is a component library built for Tailwind CSS. It provides class names for common components such as buttons, cards, form elements, dialogs, and more.

---

## Prerequisites

- A project using Tailwind CSS v4+

---

## Install the package

```bash
npm install starting-point-ui
```

---

## Import the styles

Add the import to your main CSS file:

```css label="app/globals.css"
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "starting-point-ui";
```

---

## Add the JavaScript (optional)

For interactive components like dialogs and dropdowns, you can include the JavaScript.

### Using a CDN

Add the script tag to your HTML file:

```html label="index.html"
<script
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/starting-point-ui"
  type="module"
></script>
```

### Using a bundler

For client-side bundlers like Vite, you can import directly in your entry file:

```ts label="main.ts"
import "starting-point-ui";
```

### SSR frameworks

If you're using a framework with server-side rendering, you may need to ensure the script only runs on the client after the DOM is ready. This is how it's loaded on this site, which is a Next.js App Router project:

```tsx label="components/starting-point-ui.tsx"
"use client";

import { useEffect } from "react";

export function StartingPointUI() {
  useEffect(() => {
    import("starting-point-ui");
  }, []);

  return null;
}
```

Then include it in your root layout:

```tsx label="app/layout.tsx"
import { StartingPointUI } from "@/components/starting-point-ui";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        {children}
        <StartingPointUI />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

---

## Font (optional)

The examples on this site use [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) as the font. If you want the same look and feel, you can add it to your project. Here's an example using a CDN:

```html
<head>
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.bunny.net" />
  <link
    href="https://fonts.bunny.net/css?family=inter:400,500,600,700"
    rel="stylesheet"
  />
</head>
```

Or load it directly in your CSS:

```css
@import url("https://fonts.bunny.net/css?family=inter:400,500,600,700");
```

Then set it as the default font:

```css
@theme inline {
  --font-sans: "Inter", sans-serif;
}
```
